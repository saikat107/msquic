Would catch changes to hash computation logic, XOR operations, and result values. The test of all-zeros→zero and all-ones→non-zero would detect bitwise operation errors. However, it wouldn't catch subtle loop boundary issues or internal lookup table corruption since it doesn't validate intermediate states."
